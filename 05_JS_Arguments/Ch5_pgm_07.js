/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Update the text logged so that it is
 *    of the form:
 *    The player's name is Kandra
 *
 * Strings have a length property that gives
 * the number of characters in the string.
 * e.g. playerName.length.
 *
 * 2) Make the function show the number
 *    of letters in the player's name.
